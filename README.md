# RadonUI
Simple JavaScript (ES6) frontend framework.
`adamhamori` is me ;) This is a bug.
It was my old user. But I have created a new user.
But my git client committed as adamhamori. I'm sorry.
And the HTML part is only a test.
## Why RadonUI?
Because it has ONLY one dev dependency: Babel. And it's only needed when you
build the lib, there's NO RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES!
That makes RadonUI lightweight.
For example, Angular or React has 300+ dependencies.
## How to use it?
Currently, RadonUI is being developed, so it's not recommended
to use it in a production app. And now, it's not builded to static JS,
it's using Babel standalone. Later, we will build ONE `radon.js` file,
that will make the framework more easy-to-use.
But currently, you need to include Babel standalone and all the files
in the `radonui` folder. That's it!
And, alternatively, you can install it by using `npm install my-radonui`
