RadonUI
=======

RadonUI is a simple UI framework for ES6. It is supposed to be lightweight, and it is.  
It has no dependencies!

Pros
----
 * Lightweight (no external dependencies)
 * Based on ES6
 * Zlib license (no need for credits, even)

Cons
----
 * Kind of painful to use, at least compared to Vue or Svelte
 * Still W.I.P., may be buggy or lack important features
 * Quite bare-bones compared to full frameworks

Personal comments
-----------------
I tried to be as objective with the pros/cons as possible.

There is currently no tutorial or like (sadly).  
Documentation is also non-existent. However, I would  
like to invite anyone interested in helping development  
and documentation.

Examples can be found under the "test" directory.
